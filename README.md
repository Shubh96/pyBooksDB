# pyBooksDB

pyBooksDB is a basic desktop application developed using **Tkinter** and **SQLite3** in **python 3.6**. This application lets you to maintain a databased records for possibly a book store.
The application is not complete fully, there are a lot of optimisations to be made and exceptions to be handled. As of now I am not doing those, will do that soon, as the idea behind it is very simple just need to add and remove few redundant lines of code.
